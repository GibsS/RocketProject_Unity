- When the character has 2 contacts and moves, he can sometimes (rarely) clip through one of the contact. 
Solution : after leaving the 2 contact position, check if the position is coherent with the two contact (no clipping !)
** Solved **
- When the character is in a pit with 2 contacts, can only escape by one direction 
Update : not only in pit
Solution : Not certain, probably due to incoherent position state, could be a motor problem (happens for both controller)
** Solved **

- When the character reaches the edge of a platform, he very very rarely clips through the platform. 
Solution : no clue, very hard to repeat the bug and thus understand its cause. Very likely due to numerical imprecision within 
the "line movement" motor function. It's rarity might justisfy just leaving it alone...
